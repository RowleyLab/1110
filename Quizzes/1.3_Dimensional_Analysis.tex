	\subsection*{Question 1}
	Convert the value $80.0~\dfrac{miles}{h}$ to units of $\nicefrac{m}{s}$ 

\vspace{3em}
\subsection*{Question 2}
Light travels at a speed of $2.998\times10^8~\nicefrac{m}{s}$
\begin{itemize}
	\item How many $s$ does it take for light to travel from the surface of the earth to the moon and back ($478,000~miles$)?
	
	~
	
	~
	
	\item How far does light travel in one minute?
\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{Question 3}
	A cup of water is about $237~g$. How much energy is required to bring one cup of water from $25.0~^\circ C$ to $100.0~^\circ C$?

	\subsection*{Question 4}
	An adult male should consume about $2500~Cal$ each day. If $2500~Cal$ are added to $200.0~lb$ of water, how much would the water temperature change?

	\subsection*{Question 6}
	Pure gold has a density of $19.3~\dfrac{g}{cm^3}$. A small sample of pure gold measures $3.5~mm$ by $7.6~mm$ by $5.5~mm$. How much should you expect this sample to weigh?

	\section*{\emph{Caged Bird}}
	\paragraph{By Maya Angelou}~
	\begin{verse}
		A free bird leaps\\
		on the back of the wind\\
		and floats downstream\\ 
		till the current ends\\
		and dips his wing\\
		in the orange sun rays\\
		and dares to claim the sky.
		
		But a bird that stalks\\
		down his narrow cage\\
		can seldom see through\\
		his bars of rage\\
		his wings are clipped and\\
		his feet are tied\\
		so he opens his throat to sing.
		
		The caged bird sings\\
		with a fearful trill\\ 
		of things unknown\\
		but longed for still\\
		and his tune is heard\\
		on the distant hill\\
		for the caged bird\\
		sings of freedom.
		
		The free bird thinks of another breeze\\
		and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees\\
		and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn\\
		and he names the sky his own
		
		But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams\\
		his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream\\
		his wings are clipped and his feet are tied\\
		so he opens his throat to sing.\\
		
		The caged bird sings\\
		with a fearful trill\\ 
		of things unknown\\
		but longed for still\\
		and his tune is heard\\
		on the distant hill\\
		for the caged bird\\
		sings of freedom.\\
